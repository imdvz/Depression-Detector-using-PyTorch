# Depression-Detector-using-PyTorch

This repository contains scraping of tweets from Twitter.com and detecting depression from them.

It contains codes where I scrape, clean, train and find accuracy and loss for both train and validation sets.

Package used for Scraping data: snscrape (https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape)

### Note: I have scraped tweets only for learning purpose.
